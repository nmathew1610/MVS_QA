# MVS_QA

This repository was created by Nivedita Mathew to complete the MVS QA challenge. The challenge was tackled using Selenium with Java and the TestNG framework.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

1. Eclipse IDE
2. Java Development Kit (JDK)
3. TestNG and Selenium dependencies

## Steps

Follow these steps to set up and start automating:

1. **Install Java SDK**:
   Make sure you have the Java SDK installed on your device.

2. **Download Eclipse IDE**:
   Download and install Eclipse IDE from the official website.

3. **Create a Java Maven Project**:
   Open Eclipse and create a new Java Maven project to organize your automation code.

4. **Add Necessary Dependencies**:
   Open the `pom.xml` file in your project. Add the required dependencies for your automation framework, such as Selenium and TestNG.

5. **Add Dependency for Selenium and TestNG**:
   Inside the `dependencies` section of your `pom.xml`, add the necessary dependencies for Selenium and TestNG. These dependencies will allow you to use their features in your project.

6. **Create a Test Java File**:
   Create a new Java class in your project to write your test scripts. This is where you'll write and organize your test automation code.

7. **Start Automating**:
   Write your test scripts using Selenium and the TestNG framework. You can use various Selenium methods and TestNG annotations to structure and run your tests.

Remember to organize your code, use meaningful comments, and follow best practices for automation testing. This will help you create maintainable and efficient automated test scripts.

By following these steps, you'll be able to set up your project, install necessary dependencies, and start automating test scenarios using Selenium and TestNG in the Eclipse IDE.
