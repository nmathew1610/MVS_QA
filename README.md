# MVS_QA

This repository was created by Nivedita Mathew to complete the MVS QA challenge. The challenge was tackled using Selenium with Java and the TestNG framework.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

1. Eclipse IDE
2. Java Development Kit (JDK)
3. TestNG and Selenium dependencies

## Steps

Follow these steps to set up and start automating:

1. **Install Java SDK**:
   Make sure you have the Java SDK installed on your device.

2. **Download Eclipse IDE**:
   Download and install Eclipse IDE from the official website.

3. **Create a Java Maven Project**:
   Open Eclipse and create a new Java Maven project to organize your automation code.

4. **Add Necessary Dependencies**:
   Open the `pom.xml` file in your project. Add the required dependencies for your automation framework, such as Selenium and TestNG.

5. **Add Dependency for Selenium and TestNG**:
   Inside the `dependencies` section of your `pom.xml`, add the necessary dependencies for Selenium and TestNG. These dependencies will allow you to use their features in your project.

6. **Create a Test Java File**:
   Create a new Java class in your project to write your test scripts. This is where you'll write and organize your test automation code.

7. **Start Automating**:
   Write your test scripts using Selenium and the TestNG framework. You can use various Selenium methods and TestNG annotations to structure and run your tests.
